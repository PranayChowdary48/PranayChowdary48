# Hi, I'm Pranay 👋

DevOps / Platform Engineer specializing in large-scale infrastructure automation.

I build automation platforms that manage enterprise-grade load balancing infrastructure supporting millions of users across **3 geographically distributed production data centers**.

## 🚀 What I Focus On

- Automating Day0 / Day1 / Day2 infrastructure lifecycle
- Building CI/CD-driven infrastructure pipelines
- Eliminating repetitive operational work using Python & Ansible
- Designing internal automation platforms instead of manual runbooks
- Improving reliability through monitoring and proactive validation
