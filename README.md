# Hi, I'm Pranay 👋

DevOps / Platform Engineer specializing in large-scale infrastructure automation.

I enjoy identifying inefficiencies in operational workflows and replacing them with structured, reliable automation platforms. My work revolves around designing systems that reduce manual effort, improve deployment safety, and increase operational visibility. I build automation platforms that manage enterprise-grade load balancing infrastructure supporting millions of users

---

## 🚀 What I Work On

- Infrastructure Automation (Python, Ansible)
- CI/CD-driven infrastructure deployment
- AWS & Kubernetes platforms
- Enterprise load balancing (F5 BIG-IP)
- Operational intelligence & monitoring systems
- Large-scale configuration management & validation frameworks

---

## 🏗 Current Focus

- Automating Day0 / Day1 / Day2 infrastructure lifecycle
- Building CI/CD-driven infrastructure pipelines
- Eliminating repetitive operational work using Python & Ansible
- Designing internal automation platforms instead of manual runbooks
- Improving reliability through monitoring and proactive validation

## 📌 DevOps Learning Series

A progression from containerization to cloud architecture:

- 🐳 Mood of the Day – Docker (multi-service, observability-first design)
- ☸️ Mood of the Day – Kubernetes (HPA, rollouts, network policies, traffic control)
- ☁️ Mood of the Day – AWS (CloudFormation + CDK, ECS, WAF, CloudFront, DR)
- ⚡ AWS Serverless (in progress)
- 🧰 Infrastructure Automation Toolkit (in progress)

## 🧠 Engineering Approach

I believe automation should:

- Eliminate repetitive manual work  
- Improve safety and auditability  
- Provide validation before execution  
- Be observable and measurable  
- Scale without increasing operational complexity  

Good systems don't just deploy — they validate, monitor, and explain themselves.
